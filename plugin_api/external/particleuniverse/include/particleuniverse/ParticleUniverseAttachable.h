		This can be convenient if the Attachable is a Particle Affector wrapper, that affects a particle
		based on their mutual distance.
	@remarks
		This MovableObject will not be registered at the SceneManager; its purpose is to take advantage of the
		fact that it can be attached to a SceneNode. If an inherited class of Attachable uses visual (rendering)
		elements, it should use the registerAttachable() and unregisterAttachable() functions of the 
		ParticleSystemManager. This implies some additional coding, because this is not supported by the
		scripting capabilities.
