Particle Universe - Customized version
- Starting with Particle Universe Plugin V1.6 ("PU_V1.6.zip"): MIT license
- Online: http://www.fxpression.com/
- OGRE 2.0 ready
	- At the point in time of migrating to OGRE 2.0, there was no working Particle Universe version for it available
		- https://github.com/scrawl/particleuniverse/tree/Ogre_2.0 did not work
	- Constructed an own Particle Universe version
		- Used https://github.com/scrawl/particleuniverse/tree/Ogre_2.1 as start point
		- Backported it to OGRE 2.0
		- Fixed a bug inside "ParticleUniverse::BillboardRenderer::copyAttributesTo()": "Copy attributes in case there is a billboardset (which should be available)" does no longer make sense with the changes other persons made to Particle Universe
		- Reapplied our "bug_PU_EVT_NO_PARTICLES_LEFT_setIterationInterval" bugfix
